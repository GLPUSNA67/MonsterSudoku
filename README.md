The objective is to have a program that will initialize (fill in the starting values of) a published puzzle in a 16x16x16 puzzle and 
use functions to either solve individual cells or to simplify the puzzle so that other functions can solve individual cells.
The program uses Tkinter for the GUI and many variable structures to both maintain the puzzle cell values, the numbers that remain
in each cell, and each row, column, and square (RCS), the number and identity of cells that have been completed and remain to be completed,
